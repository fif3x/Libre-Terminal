# Libre-Terminal
What is the goal of Libre Terminal? The goal of this software is to provide users with an easy terminal interface, cutting cross-platform incompatibilities, being extremely fast, and lastly, very customizable, having a configuration & [SOON] plug-in system.

- Easy terminal interface? What do you mean?
With an easy terminal interface, we refer to one that does not make you memorize either hard names or extremely long commands.

- Cutting cross-platform incompatabilities? What does this mean?
With the cut of cross-platform incompatabilities we mean stopping the differences between (mainly) Linux with Windows, along with MacOS, and then every other possible OS
